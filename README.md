## 1. Title of Dataset:&#x20;

Data for paper titled " Artificial nighttime lighting and herbivory interactively reduce the biomass production of invasive plants while enhancing that of native plants"

## 2. Description of Dataset

The abbreviation and description for the variables of ALAN_data.xlsx:

ID: ID of pots

species: Latin name of the test plant

genus: Genus name of the test plant

family: Family name of the test plant

Status: species invasive status (invasive vs. native)

ALAN: Artificial light at night treatments (No-ALAN vs. ALAN)

Nutrient:  Nutrient treatments (Low-nutrient vs. High-nutrient)

Herbivory: Herbivory treatments (with herbivory [Herb+] vs. without herbivory [Herb-]) 

Compartment: Greenhouse compartments

Initial_height: Initial height of species

Initial_height_ratio: Initial height ratio. Initial height ratio was calculated by dividing the initial plant height in the herbivory treatment by the mean initial height of the corresponding control plants without herbivory exposure.	

Total_biomass: Total biomass

RMF	: Root mass fraction

Photo: Net photosynthetic rate at night

Tolerance: Tolerance score. Tolerance score was calculated by dividing the total biomass of plants in the herbivory treatment by the mean total biomass of the corresponding control plants without herbivory

The description for relative_growth_rate_data. xlsx:

ID: 	ID of pots

ALAN: Artificial light at night treatments (No-ALAN vs. ALAN)

Nutrient: Nutrient treatments (Low-nutrient vs. High-nutrient)

species: Latin name of the test plant

genus: Genus name of the test plant

family: Family name of the test plant

Status: species invasive status (invasive vs. native)

Sub_compartment: sub-greenhouse compartments

Initial_insect_weight: The initial weight of larvae

final_Insect_weigh: The final weight of larvae

âˆ†weight_insect: The difference between the final weight and initial weight of larvae

rgc: The relative growth rate of larvae
